# COP-2001
Programming fundamentals project

Simple breakout-style game, demonstrating understanding of structs, pointers, 2d arrays, and game-loops


<Setup>
  
  Look through CMAKE, need at least version 17 or later
  If on windows, remove cmake_architecture lines
  
  This project uses SFML graphics library, install using terminal on MAC, or download zip from their website, and set correct
  paths inside cmake for location of SFML
  
<Start>
  
  Press space to start the game, X to quit.
  
<WIP>
  
  Add score counter
  Fix collision checking to hide correct block
  Fix collision checking with ball & paddle (Current only recognizes collisions on the sides)
  
  Implement velocity changes upon collisions
